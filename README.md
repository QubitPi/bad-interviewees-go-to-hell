A Story of a Horrible Interviewee
---------------------------------

It was 9:55 AM in the morning.

I was ready to interview a candidate, scheduled at 10 am, for a Front-end position.

Before I entered the reserved conference room for a call, I had spent 2 hours preparing for the interview questions
based on this candidate's resume. She claimed, for example, on her resume she has decent experience working with
[webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), so I prepared a **basic** webpack question on [codeshare](https://codeshare.io/),
which was planned to be shared with her during the interview:

Given a CSS file of the following:

```css
/* Button.css */
.Button {
  padding: 20px;
}
```

How would you import this CSS file (i.e. `Button.css`) using webpack and apply its style to make a Button in a
`Button.js`?

FYI - the file structure looks like the following:

```
.
└── my-app/
    └── src/
        ├── Button.css
        └── Button.js
```

```javascript
// Button.js

// Your answer starts here
};
```

At 10, I called the number, nobody picked up. I called again, nobody picked up. I gave it a last try before giving it
up; somebody picked up. I opened the conversation first.

"Good morning, XXX. This is Mr. Liu from Paion Data. Is this still a good time for a chat?"

"Well yeah." Her voice was little more than a murmur. I suddenly figured out the reason of the last 2 missed calls, so I 
asked:

"Are you sleeping at the moment?"

"Oh yeah, I am...". Sounds like she was complaining to someone who has nothing serious to talk about.

At this moment, I can hang up and leave the room. But what if she turned out to be a smart technical guy? This what
turned out to be a naive opinion later made me decide to keep asking this candidate the prepared technical questions. 

(A few miserable moments later...)

I'll ignore the details of how horribly she answered my technical questions (by the way, she didn't even know the answer
to the webpack question above). I didn't even bother asking all of my prepared questions because I just could't stand
talking to her anymore. I decide not to disclose her identity here; she's terrible but she's not famouts, so we won't
make her famous.

But what motivated me is this question - **How do I avoid wasting even a second on such non-sense candidate in the
future?**

I'll use Data. Hence this project is brewed.
